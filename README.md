## Assignment concept

This assignment aims to get insight in Multithreading and Concurrency.  

As part of this assignment, we should create a function that generates random numbers between 20 and 50. Also create two asynchronous functions to calculate the factorials of these numbers. Conclude by printing the winning thread. Thus, we need to figure out how to handle with big Ints and observe how asynchronous functions behave in action.

The assignment covers the following topics: 
* Multithreading
* Concurrency
